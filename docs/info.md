## How it works

This chip is an 8x8 -> 16-bit multiplier with two selectable compute cores sharing the same silicon:

- An **exact** Dadda-tree multiplier using a genuine 4:2 compressor: each compressor's `cin` is wired to a
  real 5th same-weight partial-product bit (absorbing it instead of wasting a separate half-adder on it),
  rather than being tied to a constant 0 -- an earlier revision did the latter, which let synthesis
  constant-fold the compressor into something cheaper than a real 4:2 compressor, understating what "exact"
  should cost.
- An **approximate** multiplier, structurally identical except that the 10 least-significant reduction
  columns (of 15) use a custom 2-output approximate compressor instead of the full 4:2 cell: `sum = (x1^x2)
  | (x3^x4)`, `carry = (x1&x2) | (x3&x4)` -- dropping the third output (`cout`) entirely, which changes the
  reduction tree's shape (not just the per-cell cost), the main source of the area/speed savings below.
- Both cores share a **Kogge-Stone parallel-prefix final adder** (replacing a slower ripple-carry chain used
  in an earlier revision) so the final-addition stage doesn't bottleneck either variant, and the approximate
  core additionally uses a **Lower-part-OR Adder** for its lowest output bits (already-approximated bits are
  OR'd directly instead of carry-chained, cutting the carry chain length further at a small extra accuracy
  cost).
- Measured (exhaustive 65,536-vector sweep): the approximate core has 5.27% mean relative error, and
  synthesizes to sky130_fd_sc_hd roughly 31% smaller, 27% faster (min. clock period), and 20% lower power
  (real activity-based measurement, not a default toggle-rate estimate) than the exact core -- a genuine,
  simultaneous improvement on all three axes, demonstrating the accuracy/PPA trade-off of approximate
  computing, one of the four project directions from this lab's arithmetic-circuit tapeout track.

Because `tt_um` only exposes 8 dedicated input pins but an 8x8 multiply needs 16 input bits (plus a
mode-select bit to choose exact vs. approximate), the design uses a free-running 4-phase load/compute/output
protocol driven purely by `clk` (no extra strobe pin needed):

1. **Phase 0 (LOAD_A)**: `ui_in` is latched as operand A. `uio_in[0]` is latched as the mode-select bit
   (0 = exact, 1 = approximate) -- this bit rides in "for free" here because operand B isn't being loaded
   yet, so `uio_in` isn't needed for data during this phase.
2. **Phase 1 (LOAD_B)**: `ui_in` is latched as operand B.
3. **Phase 2 (COMPUTE)**: the selected core's combinational product is registered internally.
4. **Phase 3 (OUTPUT)**: the 16-bit product is driven out, high byte on `uo_out[7:0]`, low byte on
   `uio_out[7:0]` (`uio_oe` is only driven high during this phase; it's an input during phases 0-2).

The phase counter then wraps back to phase 0. One multiplication completes every 4 clock cycles.

## How to test

Drive `ui_in` = operand A and `uio_in[0]` = mode select on one clock edge, `ui_in` = operand B on the next
edge, wait one more cycle for the internal compute register, then read the 16-bit product off
`{uo_out, uio_out}` on the 4th cycle (`uio_oe` reads back as `0xFF` during this phase, confirming the chip is
driving the bidirectional pins). Repeat for the next multiplication. The `test/test.py` cocotb testbench
implements exactly this sequencing: it checks the exact-mode result is bit-exact against `a*b` for directed
corner cases plus ~200 random vectors, and reports the measured mean relative error for the approximate mode
over ~500 random vectors (expected around 5%, matching the exhaustive 65,536-vector sweep result).

## External hardware

None -- this project only needs the standard TinyTapeout PMOD/QSPI test harness to drive `ui_in`/`uio_in`
and observe `uo_out`/`uio_out`.
